How can I identify provided app is a Hybrid or Native?
1. Manually navigate to all the pages in the app
2. Note down the pages where you suspect there are web pages loaded in app
3. If no suspect found, then identify the class (android.webkit.WebView) in all the pages using Appium Inspector
4. If that locator is found in any page, then 100% this app is a Hybrid app. Since it contains a WebView in any of its pages

Can I automate that Hybrid app using Appium?
Solution 1:
1. Open Appium Inspector, Navigate to the page where we identified the class (android.webkit.WebView)
2. Click WebView/Hybrid app mode in Appium Inspector
3. In dropdown, if webviews are found then we can say that we can automate this app as Hybrid or by using WebView

Solution 2:
1. Open Chrome browser, Navigate to chrome://inspect
2. Open the page where we identified the class (android.webkit.WebView) in the mobile app
3. Wait for some time (max 30 sec) for the Web View to be listed
4. Click on the inspect in that web view
5. If the page is loaded with correct content then we can say that we can automate this app as Hybrid or by using WebView
